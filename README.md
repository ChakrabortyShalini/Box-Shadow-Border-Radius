# Box-Shadow-Border-Radius
This project demonstrates a simple card component layout using HTML and CSS. Each card contains an image, a title, and a description.  

👉 The styling is included directly inside the HTML file using a `<style>` tag, so you don’t need a separate CSS file. This makes it easy to copy and run the example in a browser quickly.
