This project showcases the use of fundamental CSS properties to create a responsive and visually appealing card component. The code utilises box-shadow for depth and border-radius for rounded corners, giving the cards a modern, soft aesthetic. The layout is managed using Flexbox to centre the cards on the page.

Features
Responsive Design: The cards are designed to be mobile-friendly.

box-shadow: Creates a subtle drop shadow to make the cards appear to lift off the page.

border-radius: Applies rounded corners to the cards and their images for a softer look.

Flexbox: Centres the card components both horizontally and vertically.

How to Use
Save the provided code as an index.html file.

Modify the CSS classes to experiment with different box-shadow values, border-radius, or colours to change the appearance of the cards.

Technologies Used
